Docker Internals

    What was the problem?
        COLAB builds many different websites. A lot were on the same stack, but the devops between
        developers was different. With some devs using MAMP and some using vvv. This made support 
        and maintence complecated.

    How does docker fit into the workflow?
        Docker with docker-compose was chosen to streamline the developer environment and make it easier for 
        support and maintientce to begin development. 

    What did I do to help the team with docker?
        While working with senoir developers, helped create new continters to solve this problem.
        I personally built the craft container however, Most of my expertice in this area was
        updating old MEAN and vvv environments to the new docker system. Interally this project
        is still being worked on and I am have been tasked with taking over the internal 
        docker-compose cli(link) that is attempting to further streamline inital dev setup.
