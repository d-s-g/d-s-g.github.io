### Who is DupontTeijinfilms?
Dupont Teijin films is a mylar films production company.
They are the one of the biggest mylar films producers in the
US.

### What was the problem?
There previous website, was confusing and 
difficult to navigate. The site itself did not drive sales and
Dupont Teijin films was looking to improve engagement to the sales team.

### What I delivered.
I built a custom theme WordPress site. Based of a custom design
and strategy from in house designers. The site was designed to showcase products, by type and drive interest to users navigating the site. The client also wanted the site to show off key product types that Dupont Teijin films specializes in.
I implemented a full custom theme, built
with ACF, custom post types and a sass front end. This was my
first full WordPress site, as I usually work on larger engineering
projects.
