### Who is Dupont Teijin films?
Dupont Teijin Films is a mylar films production company. They are the one of the largest mylar films producers in the US.

### What was the problem?
Their previous website was confusing and proved difficult to navigate. The site itself did not drive sales and Dupont Teijin Films was looking to improve engagement in the sales team.

### What did I deliver?
I built a custom theme WordPress site, based on a custom design
and strategy from in-house designers. The site was designed to showcase products by type and to drive interest to users navigating the site. The client also wanted the site to show off key product types that Dupont Teijin Films specializes in.
I implemented a full custom theme, built with ACF, custom post types and a sass front end. This was my first full WordPress site, as I usually work on larger engineering
projects.
