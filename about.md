I am <span class="highlight">interested</span> in frontend architecture, testing and optimization. I have experience with backend patterns like REST APIS, cron tasks, and queuing.

When I am not working, I'm learning <span class="highlight">new technologies</span>, learning how to cook new cuisines and thinking about where to travel to next.

I am originally from Christchurch, New Zealand and moved to Virginia in 2006. I graduated from VCU in 2014, where I studied mathematics with a focus in <span class="highlight">graph theory</span>.
