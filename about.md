I am interested in frontend architecture, testing and optimization. I have experience with backend patterns like REST APIS, cron tasks, and queuing. I have frontend experience in unidirectional architecture, es6, jQuery, flex box, webpack 3 & 4, and gulp. Right now, I am focused on learning about web workers.

When I am not working, I'm learning new technologies,  thinking about where to travel to next and cooking for my friends.

I am originally from Christchurch, New Zealand and moved to Virginia in 2006. I graduated from VCU in 2014, where I studied mathematics with a focus in graph theory.
