interested in frontend architecture, testing and optimization. I have experience with backend patterns like REST APIS, cron tasks, and queuing.

I enjoy working with teams of people to solve difficult problems for clients.

I am originally from Christchurch, New Zealand. I moved to Virginia in 2006 and graduated from VCU in 2014. I studied mathematics with a focus in graph theory.
